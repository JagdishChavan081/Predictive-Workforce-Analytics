# Predictive Workforce Analytics

 A Data-Driven Approach to Employee Retention in Multinational Corporations"


In this data science project, we address the critical challenge faced by HR departments in predicting and managing employee attrition. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that can identify employees who are more likely to leave a corporation, allowing proactive measures to retain valuable talent. Through a comprehensive case study, we delve into understanding the factors influencing employee decisions to stay or leave, exploring aspects such as job involvement, education, job satisfaction, performance, relationship satisfaction, and work-life balance.

The project unfolds in a structured manner, progressing through various tasks. Starting with the elucidation of the problem statement and business case, we move on to tasks involving the importation and visualization of the dataset. Data cleaning and the creation of training and testing datasets follow, setting the stage for the application of three distinct classifiers: logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest classifiers.

Emphasizing hands-on experience, the subsequent tasks involve assessing the classifiers using metrics like confusion matrices and F1 score. The project culminates in the training and evaluation of the classifiers, providing actionable insights for HR professionals to proactively address employee retention.
